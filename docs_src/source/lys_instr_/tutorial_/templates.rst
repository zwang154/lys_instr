Templates
=========

The following templates provide quick setup of GUIs for common instrument components.
These GUIs are designed to be intuitive and self-explanatory.
See the Advanced section for detailed user guides on each GUI component, if needed.


1D Frame, Single Frame per Run
------------------------------

**Scenario**: Acquire a spectrum with a 1D detector, one frame per run.

To use this template, provide your own motor and detector instances:

.. code-block:: python

    motor = ...  # your motor instance
    detector = ...  # your detector instance
    detectorName = "nameOfYourDetector"

    def Window():
        from lys_instr.templates.template1 import TemplateWindow
        return TemplateWindow(motor, detector, detectorName)


For demonstration, here is a realistic example.
Suppose we have a detector that acquires optical spectra, that is, pairs of wavelength and intensity values.
We rotate a polarizer (motor axis "phi") in the optical path and acquire a spectrum at each angle.
The detector collects a single spectrum (1D frame) per run.

We use a dummy motor to simulate polarizer rotation and a dummy detector to simulate spectrum acquisition.
The example data are polarization-dependent Raman spectra of FePS3, at 10 K (background-subtracted), measured in 10° increments of the polarizer angle.

.. code-block:: python

    from lys_instr import dummy
    from lys_instr.dummy.detectorData import RamanData

    motor = dummy.MultiMotorDummy("phi")
    detector = dummy.MultiDetectorDummy(data=RamanData(scanLevel=0), exposure=0.1)
    detectorName = "MultiDetectorDummy"

    def Window():
        from lys_instr.templates.template1 import TemplateWindow
        return TemplateWindow(motor, detector, detectorName)


Add the above code to ``proc.py`` in *lys*, and call this ``Window()`` from the *lys* command line to launch the GUI subwindow, as shown below:

.. image:: /lys_instr_/tutorial_/template1_1.png

In the **Scan** tab, configure the scan by selecting the motor axis "phi", setting the scan range (for example, start at 0, step by 10, for 36 steps), and specifying the exposure time (for example, 0.1 seconds).

.. image:: /lys_instr_/tutorial_/template1_2.png


A straightforward extension is to add more motor axes for scanning, using the same template.
For example, adding the "x" and "y" axes allows you to move the sample stage and perform spatial mapping of the spectra.

This is simulated by adding the "x" and "y" axes to ``MultiMotorDummy``:

.. code-block:: python

    motor = dummy.MultiMotorDummy("x", "y", "phi")    # Add "x" and "y" axes for spatial mapping


Update the motor initialization line in ``proc.py`` and call ``Window()`` to relaunch the GUI subwindow.
In the **Scan** tab, add scan loops for the "x" and "y" axes below "phi" to configure the mapping.

.. image:: /lys_instr_/tutorial_/template1_3.png

This setup performs a nested scan, acquiring data over an 8×9 grid by scanning the y-axis at each x-axis position, for 36 phi values.
The image above shows the first spectra acquired at the start of the scan.



1D Frame, Multiple Frames per Run
---------------------------------

**Scenario:** Acquire spectra with a 1D detector, multiple frames per run.

To use this template, provide your own motor and detector instances:

.. code-block:: python

    motor = ...  # your motor instance
    detector = ...  # your detector instance
    detectorName = "nameOfYourDetector"

    def Window():
        from lys_instr.templates.template2 import TemplateWindow  # Import from template2
        return TemplateWindow(motor, detector, detectorName)

For demonstration, we use the same example setup as above.

Suppose the detector is configured to acquire 36 frames in a single run, with hardware managing both polarizer rotation and frame acquisition.
During acquisition, each spectrum is sent to the GUI as a 1D frame, labeled by its index (from 0 to 35).

.. code-block:: python

    from lys_instr import dummy
    from lys_instr.dummy.detectorData import RamanData

    motor = dummy.MultiMotorDummy("x", "y")     # Omit "phi" since hardware manages polarizer rotation
    detector = dummy.MultiDetectorDummy(data=RamanData(scanLevel=1), exposure=0.1)
    detectorName = "MultiDetectorDummy"

    def Window():
        from lys_instr.templates.template2 import TemplateWindow
        return TemplateWindow(motor, detector, detectorName)

Add the above code to ``proc.py`` in *lys*, and call this ``Window()`` from the *lys* command line to launch the GUI subwindow, as shown below:

.. image:: /lys_instr_/tutorial_/template2_1.png

In the **Detector** panel, the upper plot displays the updated dataset as a 2D array, while the lower plot shows the live spectrum from the most recent frame.
The image above shows the results after completing a full 36-frame acquisition by clicking the "Start" button with no scan loops configured.

As before, you can enable spatial mapping by adding scan loops for the "x" and "y" axes in the Scan tab.






2D Frame, Single Frame per Run
------------------------------

**Scenario**: Acquire an image with a 2D detector, one frame per run.

To use this template, provide your own motor and detector instances:

.. code-block:: python

    motor = ...  # your motor instance
    detector = ...  # your detector instance
    detectorName = "nameOfYourDetector"

    def Window():
        from lys_instr.templates.template3 import TemplateWindow
        return TemplateWindow(motor, detector, detectorName)


For demonstration, consider a realistic example:
Suppose we operate an electron microscope whose detector captures 2D images.
We move the sample stage using the "x" and "y" motor axes, capturing an image at each position.
The detector acquires a single image (2D frame) per run.

We use a dummy motor to simulate stage movement and a dummy detector to simulate image acquisition, with each image filled with random noise.

.. code-block:: python

    from lys_instr import dummy
    from lys_instr.dummy.detectorData import RamanData

    motor = dummy.MultiMotorDummy("x", "y")     # Omit "phi" since hardware manages polarizer rotation
    detector = dummy.MultiDetectorDummy(frameShape=(256, 256))
    detectorName = "MultiDetectorDummy"

    def Window():
        from lys_instr.templates.template3 import TemplateWindow
        return TemplateWindow(motor, detector, detectorName)


Add the above code to ``proc.py`` in *lys*, and call this ``Window()`` from the *lys* command line to launch the GUI subwindow, as shown below:

.. image:: /lys_instr_/tutorial_/template3_1.png

In the **Scan** tab, add scan loops for the "x" and "y" axes to configure the mapping.

.. image:: /lys_instr_/tutorial_/template3_2.png

This setup performs a nested scan, capturing images over a 10×10 grid by scanning the x-axis at each y-axis position.





2D Frame, Multiple Frames per Run
---------------------------------

**Scenario**: Acquire an image with a 2D detector, Multiple frames per run.

To use this template, provide your own motor and detector instances:

.. code-block:: python

    motor = ...  # your motor instance
    detector = ...  # your detector instance
    detectorName = "nameOfYourDetector"

    def Window():
        from lys_instr.templates.template4 import TemplateWindow
        return TemplateWindow(motor, detector, detectorName)


For demonstration, consider a realistic example:
Suppose the detector is configured to acquire a 2D array of 2D images in a single run, with hardware handling image acquisition and any required operations between acquisition events.
During acquisition, each image is sent to the GUI as a 2D frame, labeled by its index within the array.
This configuration exemplifies a 4D-STEM measurement, where the electron beam raster scans a 2D grid across the sample and records a 2D diffraction pattern at each grid position.

As in previous examples, use a dummy motor and dummy detector.
Set ``indexShape=(9, 9)`` to define the 2D array size, and ``frameShape=(256, 256)`` to specify the image size.

.. code-block:: python

    from lys_instr import dummy
    from lys_instr.dummy.detectorData import RamanData

    motor = dummy.MultiMotorDummy("E")     # For later use
    detector = dummy.MultiDetectorDummy(indexShape=(9, 9), frameShape=(256, 256))
    detectorName = "MultiDetectorDummy"

    def Window():
        from lys_instr.templates.template4 import TemplateWindow
        return TemplateWindow(motor, detector, detectorName)


Add the above code to ``proc.py`` in *lys*, and call ``Window()`` from the *lys* command line to launch the GUI subwindow, as shown below:

.. image:: /lys_instr_/tutorial_/template4_2.png

In the **Detector** panel, the left image displays the mean 2D array at each pixel, and the right image shows the mean of frames selected from the left image.
You can interactively select a region in the left image to update the right image (see *lys* documentation for details on high-dimensional data visualization and analysis).

Clicking the "Start" button with no scan loops configured acquires the complete 8×8 dataset in a single run.

As in previous examples, you can add motor axes for scanning in the **Scan** tab.
For instance, you can perform 4D-STEM measurements at each step while sweeping the electric field applied to the sample.
Suppose the motor axis "E" controls the electric field:

.. image:: /lys_instr_/tutorial_/template4_3.png



Variations
----------

These templates can be readily adapted for a variety of experimental scenarios. For example:

- Add a time axis (using a motor for a delay stage in ultrafast laser experiments) and a :doc:`switch </lys_instr_/tutorial_/switchGUI>` instance to perform pump-probe measurements.

- Add a :doc:`corrector </lys_instr_/tutorial_/preCorrection>` instance to configure motor axis dependencies and cooperative axis motions.

Refer to the Advanced sections for detailed user guides on each component's GUI and for instructions on creating custom GUIs tailored to specific workflows.
