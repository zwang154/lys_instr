lys_instr documentation
=========================

*lys_instr* is a Python package for building flexible GUIs to automate scientific measurements. 

It enables researchers to quickly create custom interfaces for coordinating multiple devices and managing measurement workflows, with minimal coding required.

What can you do with *lys_instr*:

Most scientific measurements follow a *move-and-detect* patternâ€”parameters are adjusted via motors or digital controls (*move*) and data are collected through detectors (*detect*).
A measurement sequence that combines *move* and *detect* is known as a *scan*; complete workflows may involve multiple nested *scans*.
*lys_instr* helps you construct, control, and automate such workflows efficiently.
In principle, you only need to provide minimal code for device-specific communication; the package handles the rest.


Key functionalities of *lys_instr*:

- Asynchronous device control and monitoring

- Real-time data visualization and automatic data storage

- Efficient management of nested workflows


Distinctive features of *lys_instr*:

- Lightweight and efficient: designed to be fast and resource-friendly

- Modular and extensible: easy to reconfigure measurement workflows directly in the GUI

- Seamless integration with data analysis tools: *lys* (https://github.com/lys-devel/lys)
